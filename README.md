## 🎱 Powerball Number Generator & Checker
An interactive Powerball project that generates lottery numbers and checks them against winning draws, built to practice Python fundamentals, input validation, and real-world edge case handling.

The goal of this project wasn’t to “beat the lottery,” but to build a clean, defensive program that handles bad input gracefully and behaves the way a real system should.

## ✨ Technologies
  - Python 3
  - Standard Library (random, sys)
  - CLI-based interaction
